Assumptions
Application Type: The application is an ASP.NET MVC application built on .NET Framework 4.x, using controllers, Entity Framework for data access, and Angular.
Target Framework: The upgrade targets .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 8/9 (depending on long-term support preferences, with .NET 8 recommended for 2025).
Dependencies: The application uses common dependencies like Entity Framework, ASP.NET Identity, and possibly third-party libraries (e.g., Newtonsoft.Json).
Environment: The application runs on Windows, but .NET Core's cross-platform capability may be leveraged for future deployment on Linux or containers.
Configuration: The application uses web.config for configuration, which will be migrated to appsettings.json.
Controllers: Controllers are standard MVC controllers with dependencies on services, possibly using dependency injection via a framework like Autofac or Unity.
Database: The database remains unchanged (e.g., SQL Server), and Entity Framework migrations can be adapted to EF Core.
No Major Rewrites: The goal is to migrate with minimal changes to business logic, focusing on framework compatibility.


Risk Assessment
Compatibility Risks
Risk: Some .NET Framework APIs or third-party libraries may not be available in .NET Core.
Mitigation: Use the .NET Portability Analyzer and replace incompatible libraries with alternatives (e.g., use System.Text.Json instead of Newtonsoft.Json if needed).
Impact: Medium; may require code refactoring.
Database Migration Risks
Risk: EF Core may not support all EF6 features (e.g., complex type mappings).
Mitigation: Test migrations thoroughly and use EF Core-specific patterns (e.g., owned types).
Impact: High; database issues can disrupt core functionality.
Configuration Errors
Risk: Incorrect migration of web.config to appsettings.json or misconfigured middleware.
Mitigation: Validate configuration settings and test middleware pipeline in a staging environment.
Impact: Medium; can cause runtime errors.
Authentication/Authorization Issues
Risk: ASP.NET Identity migration to ASP.NET Core Identity may break authentication flows.
Mitigation: Follow Microsoftâ€™s migration guides and test authentication thoroughly.
Impact: High; affects user access and security.
Performance Risks
Risk: .NET Core may perform differently, potentially exposing bottlenecks.
Mitigation: Profile the application using tools like Application Insights and optimize as needed.
Impact: Low to Medium; .NET Core is generally faster but requires tuning.
Deployment Risks
Risk: Deployment to new environments (e.g., Linux or Docker) may introduce configuration issues.
Mitigation: Use containerized testing environments and validate deployment scripts.
Impact: Medium; can delay production rollout.
