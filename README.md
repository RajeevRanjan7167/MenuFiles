In our current workflow, when a job is delayed, subsequent jobs must be manually paused to avoid interference, followed by manual restarts, resulting in inefficiencies and potential delays. Migrating to Azure Data Factory (ADF) offers a solution with its advanced orchestration and automation capabilities. ADF can automatically manage job dependencies, ensuring that subsequent tasks are halted if a preceding job is delayed. This automation reduces manual intervention, minimizes delays, and enhances overall operational efficiency. Additionally, ADF's scheduling and monitoring tools provide greater control and visibility over job executions, streamlining processes significantly.

Migrating to Azure Data Factory eliminates the need for manual intervention in stopping and restarting jobs during delays. ADF offers automated job orchestration, dynamic scheduling, and robust monitoring features, reducing manual effort while enhancing the reliability and efficiency of job execution. This streamlined approach improves operational consistency and performance.
