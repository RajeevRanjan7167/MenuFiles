Implementation Plan for Modernizing the Application from ASP.NET Web Forms to a .NET Core Web API with a Microservices Architecture and Angular-based UI

Phase 1: Planning and Assessment (Weeks 1–4)





Define Objectives: Establish goals (e.g., scalability, performance) and project scope.



Assess Legacy System: Analyze Web Forms codebase, dependencies, and database.



Design Architecture: Plan microservices using domain-driven design and REST APIs.



Tool Selection: Choose .NET Core, Angular, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.



Risk Mitigation: Identify risks and plan training and phased rollouts.

Phase 2: Development Setup and Prototyping (Weeks 5–8)





Environment Setup: Configure .NET Core, Node.js, and CI/CD pipelines.



Prototype Microservice: Build and test a sample microservice with Angular UI.



Database Planning: Plan data migration to distributed schemas.



Team Training: Train on .NET Core, Angular, and microservices patterns.

Phase 3: Incremental Development and Refactoring (Weeks 9–16)





Backend Refactoring: Convert Web Forms logic to .NET Core microservices.



Angular UI Development: Build reusable UI components with Angular.



API Integration: Develop and test APIs with Swagger and Postman.



Data Migration: Incrementally migrate data, ensuring integrity.



Testing: Implement unit and integration tests in CI/CD pipeline.

Phase 4: Deployment and Testing (Weeks 17–20)





Containerization: Package services in Docker and deploy with Kubernetes.



Staged Deployment: Use strangler pattern for parallel legacy and new system operation.



End-to-End Testing: Conduct performance, security, and UAT testing.



User Feedback: Collect beta testing feedback for refinements.

Phase 5: Go-Live and Optimization (Weeks 21–24)





Production Rollout: Deploy to production, phasing out Web Forms.



Monitoring: Use Application Insights or Prometheus for performance tracking.



Optimization: Address bottlenecks using profiling tools.



Documentation: Document architecture, APIs, and processes.

Phase 6: Post-Implementation and Maintenance (Ongoing)





User Support: Train users and address feedback.



Continuous Improvement: Iterate based on usage analytics.



Security Maintenance: Apply patches and conduct audits.



Scalability: Monitor and scale services using cloud features.

Key Considerations





Collaboration: Ensure alignment across backend, frontend, and DevOps teams.



Change Management: Communicate progress to stakeholders.



Budget: Allocate resources for tools, training, and infrastructure.



Rollback Plan: Maintain strategy to revert to Web Forms if needed.
