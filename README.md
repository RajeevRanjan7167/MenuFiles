Risk Assessment
Complexity of Web Forms Logic:
Risk: Web Forms’ heavy reliance on ViewState, postbacks, and server controls makes it challenging to refactor code-behind logic into RESTful APIs.
Mitigation: Carefully extract business logic into services, test each API endpoint, and use tools like Postman to validate functionality.
Impact: High; missteps can break core functionality.
Learning Curve:
Risk: The team’s limited Angular experience may lead to errors in SPA development, RxJS usage, or component architecture.
Mitigation: Provide Angular training, use Angular CLI for scaffolding, and follow Angular style guides.
Impact: Medium; delays initial development but improves with experience.
Authentication Migration:
Risk: Transitioning from ASP.NET Membership/Forms Authentication to JWT may introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g., improper token storage).
Mitigation: Use secure token handling (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or localStorage with sanitization) and validate JWT configuration.
Impact: High; security issues can compromise user data.
State Management:
Risk: Replacing ViewState and Session with Angular state management may lead to data inconsistencies or increased complexity.
Mitigation: Use Angular services or state management libraries (e.g., NgRx) for complex state needs, and test thoroughly.
Impact: Medium; affects user experience if not handled properly.
Performance:
Risk: Angular’s client-side rendering may increase initial load times compared to Web Forms’ server-side rendering.
Mitigation: Implement lazy loading, Angular Universal for SSR, or pre-rendering for SEO/performance.
Impact: Medium; impacts user experience but can be optimized.
Dependency Compatibility:
Risk: Legacy Web Forms dependencies (e.g., third-party controls) may not have equivalents in .NET Core or Angular.
Mitigation: Replace unsupported controls with Angular Material or custom components, and verify .NET Core package compatibility.
Impact: Medium; may require UI redesign or additional development.
Deployment Challenges:
Risk: Separate deployment of Angular and .NET Core may introduce configuration errors (e.g., CORS, API URLs).
Mitigation: Use environment variables, test in staging, and automate deployments with CI/CD pipelines.
Impact: Medium; can delay production rollout.
Testing Gaps:
Risk: Incomplete test coverage for Angular components or APIs may miss regressions, especially for complex Web Forms logic.
Mitigation: Write unit tests (Jasmine/Karma for Angular, xUnit for .NET Core) and end-to-end tests (Cypress).
Impact: High; regressions can disrupt functionality.




Angular Project Setup
Create a new Angular project: ng new my-app --style=scss.
Install dependencies: npm install @angular/material rxjs jwt-decode.
Set up modules, components, and services for modularity.
Configure environment.ts for API base URLs.
UI Migration
Map Web Forms to Angular Components:
Each .aspx page becomes an Angular component (e.g., Products.aspx → ProductListComponent).
Replace server controls (e.g., <asp:GridView>) with Angular templates and directives (e.g., *ngFor).
Handle Events:
Replace postback events (e.g., <asp:Button OnClick="...">) with Angular event bindings (e.g., (click)="...").
Forms:
Migrate Web Forms validation and data binding to Angular reactive forms.
State Management:
Replace ViewState and Session with Angular services or localStorage.
Controller Integration
API Endpoints: Expose endpoints like GET /api/products and GET /api/products/{id}.
Angular Services: Use HttpClient to call APIs from Angular services.
Error Handling: Implement Angular HTTP interceptors for global error handling.
Authentication Migration
Implement JWT authentication in the .NET Core API.
Create an Angular AuthService to manage tokens and add them to API request headers.
Secure API endpoints with [Authorize] attributes.
Testing
Test APIs with Swagger or Postman.
Write Angular unit tests (Jasmine/Karma) and end-to-end tests (Cypress).
Perform integration testing to verify front-end/back-end communication.
Deployment
Deploy Angular to a static host (e.g., Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify).
Deploy .NET Core API to a server (e.g., Azure App Service, Docker).
Configure environment variables for API URLs.
