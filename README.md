ASP.NET 4.5.2 is an outdated framework that may not fully utilize modern cloud capabilities or integrate efficiently with newer technologies. Upgrading or refactoring the codebase may be necessary to ensure compatibility with cloud environments and to take advantage of performance improvements, security enhancements, and modern service integrations. This would also help future-proof the application and enable smoother adoption of cloud-native features.
